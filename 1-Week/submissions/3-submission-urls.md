Which {summary} would you rank higher considering following {criteria}?

Summaries:
Prompt engineering is the discipline focused on creating and optimizing prompts to effectively utilize large language models (LLMs) for various applications. Key components of a prompt include instructions, context, input data, and output indicators. The temperature setting influences the randomness of model outputs; lower temperatures yield more deterministic results, while higher temperatures encourage creativity. Zero-shot prompting involves asking the model to respond without examples, whereas few-shot prompting provides examples to guide the model's responses. Effective prompt design includes starting simple, being specific, and avoiding ambiguities. Ethical considerations in prompt engineering involve mitigating bias, ensuring transparency, and protecting user privacy. Chain-of-Thought prompting enhances reasoning by guiding the model through logical steps, while few-shot prompting has limitations in complex reasoning tasks. Integrating external knowledge sources can improve prompt effectiveness by providing up-to-date information.
